# Practice Selenium Automation  

## 🧪 Project Overview  
This repository holds a practice automation project using Selenium WebDriver for web-testing.  
The aim is to build, experiment and refine basic automation scripts to automate browser actions, validate web elements and understand test workflows.  
This serves as a sandbox for learning and improving automation skills.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Get hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver and browser automation.  
- Automate simple test flows (navigation, assertions, element interactions).  
- Learn how to structure test scripts and manage various test conditions.  
- Build a foundation for more advanced automation projects and frameworks.

If you like, I can generate **badges** (Node.js, Selenium, GitHub Actions) and a **banner graphic** at the top of the README to give it a more polished look. Would you like me to add those?
